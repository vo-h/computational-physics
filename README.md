# General Computational Physics/Chemistry Code
This repository contains code for a varirety of computational physics and chemistry methods in different languages (src-`$LANGUAGE`). The goal is two-fold: 
1. To understand more deeply the algorithms behind these methods by implementing them from scratch, and 
2. To get a feel for these popular languages and how they compare in terms of performance and usability for scientific computing.

First stop: Closed shell Hartree-Fock calculations in Python and C.
